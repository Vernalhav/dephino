This website is a game in which a random english word is chosen along with its dictionary definition. Your goal is to guess the word based on its dictionary definition.


## Cool ideas
* Hard mode -> don't show how many letters the word has
* Limiter -> choose to omit specific fields e.g. examples/synonyms/antonyms


## TODO
* Change colors of part of speech, title, etc.
* Dark theme
* Add source
* H1 Line height (mobile line break)
* Multiple language support
* Set up GH actions to [deploy subfolder](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36782467/set-subdirectory-as-website-root-on-github-pages)
* Merge different etymologies in `/api.js`?
* Add list with previous attempts?
* Add timer to score?
* Add word of the day?
* Try the icon as a negative-space shape, or add a stroke.
